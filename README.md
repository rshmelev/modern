This lib is my own framework to build golang apps with ease.   
Modern lib has many parts and uses also many other libs that are published separately on Github.   
Main idea was to give few functions for developer to get rich functionality with few function calls.    
I suggest to not use this library in production until it will be tested more.  
Anyways, i'm sure you'll not use it until good documentation will be available :) 
So this is kind of protection..
